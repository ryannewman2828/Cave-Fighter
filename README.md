# Cave-Fighter
A Java game based on Edmund McMillen’s and Florian Himsl’s, "The Binding of Isaac". The game uses a chunking algorithm to procedurally generate room layouts and fills them with random enemies in one of many predetermined patterns. This project uses abstraction when declaring things like power ups, enemies and bosses. Polymorphism is used when these classes need specialized actions for generic method calls, examples being the move and attack functionalities. These classes also used encapsulation to hide their information from the user and other classes within the project. The objective of the game is to fight through rooms until you reach the boss room. When the boss is defeated the game resets.
